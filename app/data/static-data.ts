      Laura is the founder and creator of The Subtle Body and Heart Healing energy therapy modality. She invites everyone to tap into their God given inherit ability to heal, end their suffering, and experience peace. She believes Heaven on earth is possible and that we don’t have to die in order to live it. 

      Laura’s primary experience came through her own healing after 37 painful years of suffering in chronic pain from what doctors claimed were “incurable illnesses.” Through the tears of pain, she heard the quiet whisper of reassurance in her heart and mind, “Don’t give up. It won’t always be like this. One day, your healing will come.”

      After decades of shifting through doctors, specialists, surgeries, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, Laura was finally led to holistic ancient medicine practices where she learned to focus on healing her energetic body first. 

      By embracing a combination of shamanic plant medicine, Eastern medicine principles, and diet changes, Laura received a complete healing of all her diagnoses through the power of Jesus Christ. Thankfully, she also received understanding of the purpose behind her decades of pain. She sees the gift in it all and knows pain does not have to be in vain. 

      She desires everyone who suffers to discover what their subtle body is trying to tell them. There is a purpose in every person’s suffering. The sooner we discover the purpose of the pain, the sooner we can be free of it. Laura opened her Energy Therapy practice wherein she served one-on-one clients, hosted workshops, and retreats, she was called to “Bring The Healers Together”.  This calling is what fueled the launch of The Subtle Body & Heart Healing Certification Program and a network of healing practitioners who now serve as teachers of energy therapy modalities and self healing practices to clients around the world.`,
