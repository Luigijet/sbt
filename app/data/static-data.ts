      Laura is the founder and creator of The Subtle Body and Heart Healing energy therapy modality. She invites everyone to tap into their God given inherit ability to heal, end their suffering, and experience peace. She believes Heaven on earth is possible and that we don’t have to die in order to live it. 

      Laura’s primary experience came through her own healing after 37 painful years of suffering in chronic pain from what doctors claimed were “incurable illnesses.” Through the tears of pain, she heard the quiet whisper of reassurance in her heart and mind, “Don’t give up. It won’t always be like this. One day, your healing will come.”

      After decades of shifting through doctors, specialists, surgeries, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, Laura was finally led to holistic ancient medicine practices where she learned to focus on healing her energetic body first. 

      By embracing a combination of shamanic plant medicine, Eastern medicine principles, and diet changes, Laura received a complete healing of all her diagnoses through the power of Jesus Christ. Thankfully, she also received understanding of the purpose behind her decades of pain. She sees the gift in it all and knows pain does not have to be in vain. 

      She desires everyone who suffers to discover what their subtle body is trying to tell them. There is a purpose in every person’s suffering. The sooner we discover the purpose of the pain, the sooner we can be free of it. Laura opened her Energy Therapy practice wherein she served one-on-one clients, hosted workshops, and retreats, she was called to “Bring The Healers Together”.  This calling is what fueled the launch of The Subtle Body & Heart Healing Certification Program and a network of healing practitioners who now serve as teachers of energy therapy modalities and self healing practices to clients around the world.`,

      An avid learner of life, roaming the beach in Costa Rica, girl finds herself by being
      introduced to the Emotion Code…the beginning of my new chapter in life!
      This healing modality fell into my lap like a missing puzzle piece. I have been studying many different ways to improve and grow my spirit. I teach yoga to adults and children, I enjoy breathwork techniques and I cherish my meditation time. Each modality I have learned and worked with over the years has vastly improved my life in some way.

      I began studying social-emotional intelligence in 2020 with the objective to bring awareness to children. I feel important spiritual and energetic teachings are missing in our current method of educating young minds. Education systems are leaving out our intuition and our ability to feel energy; discounting the children who are incredibly attuned to the ethereal world. With social-emotional intelligence, I intend to shed light into this neglecting subject.

      I made the move to Costa Rica with my brother to advance my learning in another healing modality; plant medicine. On the beach one day, a shared friend of ours, informed me that I should look into emotion code certification. I jumped at the opportunity to learn more and have been hooked ever since. This has been a blessing and an immense awakening of my spirit since the moment I started researching as well as practicing.

      I look forward to all of the teachings and healing to come from providing this support to others. My spirit feels more complete since incorporating this healing into my daily life. I look forward to every opportunity I receive to bless this onto others; for the journey together is inspiring and loving each step of the way.`,

      My healing journey has shown me what is possible, which is has me in awe. I am dedicated to sharing my greatest understanding of truth and offering numerous opportunities for others to experience it. I'm blessed with the opportunity of witnessing my client's possibilities, helping them to believe in themselves and guiding them toward a life of balance, love, and radical self-acceptance.

      I help people identify and understand their patterns, empowering them to create meaningful changes and transformations.

      I utilize a unique modality called the Pollen Pathway. Just as bees meticulously navigate their way to find pollen, I guide our clients through their symptoms and desires using muscle testing. This allows us to determine the precise modalities needed to support your physical body, mind, and spirit. The Pollen Pathway balances life's moments and transforms them into the fulfilling lives you aspire to live.

      Healing is a daily practice that brings me joy, and I am committed and honored to supporting others on their journeys.`,

      On her journey to physical well-being, she has become acquainted with the beauty and intelligence of Mother Nature. She has full confidence in the body’s ability to heal, and wants all to learn how to connect to their personal power. Through the courses she has created, individuals gain the tools to open their hearts to the love of the Heavens.

      I have seen how shifting beliefs about yourself, can release the stress you carry every day. The body can then shift out of fight-or-flight, so that you can have the resources and energy to heal.`,

      Healing doesn’t have a destination, it is a journey.  I have been on my healing journey since early childhood. I started with Western modalities like counseling, medication, and trauma therapy, but real healing began 2 years ago when I was able to experience sacred plant medicines, eastern practices of breathwork, and deep meditation. I have been medication free for 2 years now and no longer experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.  My journey have offered me not only healing, but priceless experience that I use to facilitate others on their journey.

      Life isn’t about becoming, it is about remembering.  Remembering that we came to this earth whole and by clearing programing, traumas, generational imprints, negative beliefs and trapped emotions we can live a life full of joy and realize our potential.  I believe that experiences are only “traumas” until we process the emotions associated, then the “traumas” turn into wisdom.

      I am here to facilitate healing, and teach those I work with how to further their own healing by creating daily practices that support physical, mental, and spiritual health.  There is power in surrendering to who we truly are; divine beings with a divine purpose. 

      My personal journey has provided me not just healing, but learning as well.  I am certified in PSYCH-K, a process designed to create a balanced identification with both hemispheres of the cerebral cortex.  This ‘whole brain state’ is ideal for reprogramming the mind.  I also have experience as an Intuitive Life Coach, The Emotion Code, Body Code, Courts of Heaven, trauma therapies, plant medicine integration, breathwork, meditation, and visualization techniques.`,

      Joshua had been doing talk therapy healing work with active duty military and veterans for over 18 years when he went through significant relationship and family stressors.  He found that much of his skills and tools such as cognitive behavioral therapy and DBT were not able to fully help him move forward and heal.  When he became acquainted with Energy work, and Energy healing he really noticed miraculous differences. Although he was doing therapy professionally it was like something major was missing. 

      This was over 5 years ago and as an avid student and teacher Josh has been utilizing the skills and tools daily. He has seen the rapid difference in his effectiveness as a healer, and Energy Healing modalities have opened up the miracles for others.  

      One of the major things that Josh says is: “thoughts are the language of the mind, that's what we have gotten in Psychology for 150 years.  Emotions are the language of the body, energy work access emotions and beyond to bring a miraculous balance.”`,
